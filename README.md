<pre>
This System was made for an end of course project at PUC-Rio, but focusing into generating a integrated system that can provide a unified plataform to support analyst, infrastructure analist, IT analyst and also the client.<br>
Right now the only implemented modules are the docummentation of services, where services can be applications and such, and the diagnostico tools, that provide diagnostic for applications and services. Both are still being implemented but can already be use.<br>
The docummentation and the database are already prepared to the other modules that are not yet implemented, that are troubleticketing and monitoring. The goal is to have register of services and applications, monitored by the System, and in case clients need to contact about a service, the troubleticket module would fit.<br>
The Base folder contains files that can be used from a generic perspective to other projects, there you will find a lot of generic implementations, configuration files, images and docummentation.<br>
The InfraTools folder is the actual System with only the specific application being developed.<br>
