Description: This file is how to configure the system to run, by installing Apache 2.4.25 and PHP 7.1.1. 
             It might be able to run it on different version of both Apache and PHP as long as it is 2.4.+ and PHP 7.+.
			 This how to is based on the current paths I use for my directories, both for the project and for the sofwares needed.
			 For the Pear module package, maybe a different version could be used, but it has not been tested, it would only need to be compatible with PHP 7.+. For MySql, i used 5.7, but for different if you could run the DataBase Script in the DataBase folder, in a differente version i think it is ok to use it.

Operational System:
			- Windows 7 (x64) or Windows 10 (x64) (Both tested)

Softwares:
			- Apache 2.4.25 (Windows x64)
			- PHP 7.1.1     (Windows x64)
			- PEAR 1.1.0 
			- MySql 5.7     (Windows x64)

Downalods: Bellow i have uploaded my version of Apache, PHP, Pear and MySql that I use for this documment, that enables me to build 
           the project in any windows 7 or 10 machine that I use. In production i would use a Ubuntu Server but there will be another installation documment for that. The MySql is an offical installer download directly from the Oracle website with my own account, and then compressed.
